\section{Discussion}
The identification of problems with
quantum speed-ups is an important area
of quantum computing research.
While theoretically interesting,
the SDP for identifying the optimal quantum query
complexity and a query optimal quantum algorithm
for arbitrary Boolean functions did not provide
an immediate use to researchers.
We hope that our implementation of the span program
will prove helpful in the development of
optimal quantum algorithms.

There are several possible avenues for future work.
First, additional functions with worst-case
inputs may be explored to reduce runtime.
Second, a feature to identify the best polynomial
fit (e.g. squareroot or linear) may be added
to automatically categorize the asymptotic behavior
of a given Boolean function.
Finally, further optimizations in the
eigenvalue decomposition step of our iteration
can be made to further reduce runtime.
