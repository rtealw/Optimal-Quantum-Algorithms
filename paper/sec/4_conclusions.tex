\section{Changes to Scope}

To increase scope, we may consider the dual of the SDP
we are implementing.
The dual tells us the optimal quantum algorithm for the Boolean
function input, rather than just the optimal quantum query complexity.

To decrease scope, we may implement the SDP only in existing
convex optimization libraries such as CVXOPT.
We may also consider either Boolean functions with a bounded
number of input bits or solved Boolean functions such as "or,"
"and," and "xor."
