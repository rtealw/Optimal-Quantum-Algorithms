\section*{Abstract}

The development of quantum algorithms is an important area
of research as the creation of large quantum computers
becomes more feasible. Quantum computers can accomplish
certain tasks more efficiently than classical computers by
taking advantage of certain properties of quantum mechanics.
The runtime of a quantum algorithm on a given input is
thought to be well approximated by the quantum query
complexity of the algorithm on the input. We build on
existing research that represents optimal adversary bounds
on quantum query complexity for boolean functions as
semi-definite programming problem. Specifically, we aim to
create a tool that finds these optimal bounds for a given
boolean function via semi-definite programming more
efficiently than general solvers by taking advantage of the
structure in each of these problems.

We store our coding implementation and work at
